I grew up in the Bay Area surrounded by the buzz of Silicon Valley. Watching these tech giants make real impacts on people's lives sparked something in me - I wanted to be part of that world.
This passion led me to UC Santa Cruz where I pursued my Computer Science degree. While the coursework taught me a lot, what really fulfilled me was working with two research labs where I could see my code making tangible differences in people's lives. At the Computer Vision Lab, I built tools to help visually impaired users navigate spaces, and at the Tech4Good Lab, I developed systems that meaningfully improved how teams collaborated.

After graduation, I jumped into the professional world as a Software Engineer at a consulting firm. Working with autonomous vehicle (AV) technologies was fascinating - I engineered pipelines (with Python and SQL) that analyzed AV data and built vision systems that caught safety issues before they became problems. This experience showed me something crucial: the incredible power of data in shaping better decisions and building better products.
This realization sparked my next move. I wanted to dig deeper into how data and software development intersect, so I decided to pursue my Master's in Data Science at Duke. Here, I'm working on research that identifies clinical biases in healthcare data and am a Graduate Teaching Assitant for Data Engineering Courses at Duke (Data Engineering Systems | IDS 706 and Data Analysis at Scale in Cloud | IDS 721 taught by Noah Gift). 

Whether I'm coding in Python, building machine learning models, or diving into cloud platforms, what drives me is using technology to solve real problems that matter. When I'm not coding or analyzing data, you might find me running ARAMs in Summoner's Rift!
